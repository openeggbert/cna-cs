/// One decoded video frame, together with the identity that says whether it is the same frame as
/// last time.
///
/// <b>Why this exists.</b> XNA's <c>VideoPlayer</c> owns two stable <c>Texture2D</c> frame buffers
/// and hands the same objects back over and over, so a game can compare references to notice a new
/// frame. CNA's <c>GetTexture</c> returns a borrowed alias valid only until the next call on the
/// player, and no reference comparison means anything against it -- which was recorded as a native
/// blocker for XNA parity.
///
/// <see cref="Generation"/> is CNA's answer to the second half of that: not stable identity, but an
/// explicit validity generation. Equal across two reads means the same pixels; higher means the
/// frame advanced. It is monotonic for the player's whole life and is never restarted -- not by
/// <c>Stop</c>, not by playing a different video -- because restarting it would give the first
/// frame of a second playback the same value as the first frame of the first, and inequality would
/// stop meaning "changed".
///
/// <b>This does not make a frame cacheable.</b> The texture is borrowed on exactly the terms
/// <c>GetTexture</c> documents and expires on the next call to the player, generation or no
/// generation. What the generation removes is the need to re-upload or re-compare an unchanged
/// frame.
