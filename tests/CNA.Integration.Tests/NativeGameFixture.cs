/// One native game, shared by every test in the assembly.
///
/// Native allows exactly one C-owned game at a time, and a game refuses to be destroyed while a
/// resource created against it is still alive. Both are reasonable rules and together they make
/// "a game per test" unworkable: any test that leaves a native-backed wrapper to its finalizer --
/// which is most of them, since XNA's <c>EffectTechnique</c>, <c>EffectPass</c> and friends are not
/// <c>IDisposable</c> and no ported game disposes them -- can leave the slot occupied, and then
/// every *later* test fails to create a game.
///
/// That was not hypothetical. Each of these tests passed alone; run together, between six and
/// thirty-eight failed depending on GC timing and test order, all with the same misleading "only
/// one C-owned CNA game may be active" message pointing at an innocent test.
///
/// Forcing finalizers before the destroy narrows the window and does not close it, because
/// reachability is not something a test can promise. One shared game removes the question: there is
/// no second create to fail, and cleanup ordering stops being load-bearing.
///
/// This mirrors how a real game runs -- one game, many frames -- so it is closer to the thing under
/// test, not a concession.
